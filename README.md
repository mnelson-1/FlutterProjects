Your app must meet the following criteria:

Be at least two screens.
Validate at least 3 Input fields.
Input Validation scripts written for every input type.
Folder properly structured with the main.dart file containing only the void main() method, the runApp() function, and the main logics while the screens are written in separate files.
You won't be graded for a beautiful Application. However, the user interface should be a bit appealing.
Buttons available on the screen(s).
The Input fields show relevant error messages when the validations fail.
Code documented and the logics explained in comments.
You should not stress about adding components to the application which are not stated in this assignment. Stick to building a simple application that demonstrates your understanding of Input validation in Flutter.
